# Production Process Optimization – Data Analytics Case Study

## Overview
This project analyzes a manufacturing production process to identify bottlenecks, delays, and rework drivers using Excel and R.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- R (tidyverse, ggplot2)

## Key Insights
- Welding is the primary production bottleneck.
- Assembly delays are caused by capacity accumulation.
- Corrective maintenance correlates with higher delay and rework rates.

## Project Structure
- data/: raw and processed datasets
- analysis/: R scripts and visual outputs
- case_study/: full written case study
